Full code for mean stack tutorial in thinker.io. This is a very good practice of the MEAN stack. Hopefully this will help you get a basic understanding of how the MEAN stack works.

The tutorial can be found at <a href="https://thinkster.io/angulartutorial/mean-stack-tutorial/">https://thinkster.io/angulartutorial/mean-stack-tutorial/</a>. It introduces how to work with the MEAN stack including building a REST interface with Express.js on top of Node.js and using that interface to perform CRUD operations(actually only 'CRU', but no 'D') on a database(MongoDB) via an Angular.js frontend.

In this project 'D' part of CRUD operations is already added. A post can be deleted along with the comments belong to it.

## Install & Run

		$ npm install
		$ npm start


Other functions whatever come to my mind will be updated later.

Enjoy!
